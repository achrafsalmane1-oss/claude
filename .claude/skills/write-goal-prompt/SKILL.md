# Skill: Write Goal Prompt

Converts a free-form task into a `/goal` command ready to paste into Claude Code. Designed for approval-gated in-session work - agent runs against a fixed signal and leaves a structured report. Output: a lean goal condition (well under 4000 chars) carrying task content, a compact `[PARAMS]` block, and a HARNESS.md pointer. The standing protocol - execution stages, eval loop, tiered fallbacks, proof, morning report, context compaction, turn limit - lives in HARNESS.md (read first), not inlined in the goal condition.

## Execution Router (Run Before Phase 0)

**Step 0 - Resolve project target and workspace root (do this before anything else).** The loop anchors artifacts to the project target while Git safety checks anchor to the containing workspace repository. Resolve both once:

```bash
normalize_path() {
  if command -v cygpath >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    cygpath -m "$1"
  else
    (cd "$1" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P) || printf '%s\n' "$1"
  fi
}

INVOCATION_ROOT=$(normalize_path "$(pwd -P)")
GIT_ROOT_RAW=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || true)

if [ -n "$GIT_ROOT_RAW" ]; then
  GIT_ROOT=$(normalize_path "$GIT_ROOT_RAW")
  PROJECT_ROOT="$GIT_ROOT"
  WORKSPACE_ROOT=$(dirname "$GIT_ROOT")

  case "$INVOCATION_ROOT" in
    "$GIT_ROOT"/pipelines/*)
      PIPELINE_RELATIVE=${INVOCATION_ROOT#"$GIT_ROOT"/pipelines/}
      case "$PIPELINE_RELATIVE" in
        ""|*/*) ;;
        *)
          PROJECT_ROOT="$INVOCATION_ROOT"
          WORKSPACE_ROOT="$GIT_ROOT"
          ;;
      esac
      ;;
  esac
else
  PROJECT_ROOT="$INVOCATION_ROOT"
  WORKSPACE_ROOT=$(dirname "$INVOCATION_ROOT")
fi
```

A direct `pipelines/<name>` invocation remains the project target and uses the containing Git root as its workspace boundary; readiness decides whether that target is canonical and allowed. Standalone repositories use their Git toplevel as the project target and its parent as the strict workspace boundary. If no Git root exists, the physical current directory is the target and its parent is the boundary.

Everything this run writes lives under `$PROJECT_ROOT`:

- **Working dir:** `$PROJECT_ROOT/.harness/goals/<slug>/` - BRIEF.md, PLAN.md, issues/, PROGRESS.md, CYCLE_LOG.md, HANDOFF.*
- **Backlog:** run tasks-axi from `$PROJECT_ROOT` so it resolves the project-local `.tasks.toml` (seeded by `/setup-harness`), not the monorepo one.
- **Commits:** the Maker works from `$PROJECT_ROOT`; Git resolves `$WORKSPACE_ROOT` for a tracked pipeline.
- **readiness / treehouse:** pass `$PROJECT_ROOT` as the target and `$WORKSPACE_ROOT` as its trust boundary.

Pass both resolved absolute paths to every harness agent. Agents write bare artifact names relative to `$PROJECT_ROOT`.

### Step 0.1 - Resolve Planner skill routing with the executable guard

Planner has no Bash and must not decide filesystem fallback. Resolve this skill's `scripts/resolve-skill-routing.ts` path and `$PROJECT_ROOT` as data. Invoke both CLI modes with an argument-vector process API, never by inserting either path into `bash -c` source:

```text
resolution argv: ["bun", ROUTING_RESOLVER, "--project-root", PROJECT_ROOT]
guard argv:      ["bun", ROUTING_RESOLVER, "--emit-shell-guard", "--project-root", PROJECT_ROOT]
```

The resolution call prints JSON. On a nonzero exit, preserve that JSON and do not invoke Planner. On success, pass stdout unchanged in the Planner invocation context:

```text
[SKILL_ROUTING_RESOLUTION]
<exact ROUTING_EVIDENCE JSON>
```

The guard-generation call prints a complete POSIX shell snippet. The resolver applies standard single-quote argument escaping to every absolute path, so `$()`, backticks, spaces, and quotes remain literal argv data. Insert that stdout unchanged under `[ROUTING_GUARD]` in the generated goal. Do not hand-build the command, replace path placeholders, or re-quote the output. At runtime, execute the emitted snippet immediately before Planner. It prints `ROUTING_EVIDENCE` and exits with the resolver's nonzero status, so Planner stays blocked on malformed or unreadable routing.

Keep the Step 0.1 JSON and pass it to Harness Architect during Phase 1.5. The runtime JSON is authoritative for Planner. For `project-local` or `canonical`, readers use only `normalizedPath`. For `direct`, use confirmed HARNESS routing or a documented direct quality bar. Do not fall through a present malformed or unreadable file.

Then determine execution mode. Ask if not obvious from context. This is the **infrastructure** axis (where/how the harness runs); it is distinct from the *task-shape* axis in the "Execution Mode Routing" section below (`references/execution-mode-routing.md`).

| Task shape                                  | Mode                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| < 1 hr, needs back-and-forth decisions      | **in-session harness** - proceed to Phase 0                             |
| > 1 hr, fully specifiable                   | **in-session approval-gated harness** - budget phases, remain attached  |
| Multiple independent streams simultaneously | **treehouse-isolated sessions** - run readiness before explicit leasing |

No route starts a detached process. Run the non-launching readiness check before work, and use `references/parallel-execution.md` when isolation is required.

**Always register in tasks-axi first - run from `$PROJECT_ROOT` so it hits the project-local backlog:**

```bash
cd "$PROJECT_ROOT"
tasks-axi add <slug> "<one-line title>"
tasks-axi start <slug>
# On completion: tasks-axi done <slug> [--pr <url>]
```

Slug format: `<domain>-<3-4-word-kebab>` e.g. `outbound-rbs-sequence-v3`, `content-linkedin-batch-q3`.

---

## What `/goal` Is

`/goal <condition>` sets an autonomous loop: Claude works, then a small model checks whether the condition holds. Repeats until met or you run `/goal clear`. Requires Claude Code v2.1.139+.

---

## Phase 0: Eval Loop Design

**No subagents — author decision work. Run before intake.**

A goal without an eval is a task description. Output: the eval values for the goal's `[PARAMS]` block (reward signal, done threshold, max cycles) — the loop mechanics live in HARNESS.md's `EVAL_LOOP` section. See `references/eval-loop-design.md` for the four design questions, human-judgment flag, and task-type lookup.

Produce: single reward signal (programmatic — flag if human judgment required) · mechanical gate (binary, seconds, no LLM) · qualitative gate (scored) · max_cycles (default 3) · done condition (exact threshold).

---

## Phase 0.5: Clarity Gate

**Run after Phase 0, before Phase 1.** Resolve ambiguity BEFORE authoring the goal. Do not skip lightly - an unclear goal wastes an unsupervised run. Route on task size; branch bodies live in `references/clarity-gate.md`.

**Skip only when** all Phase 1 fields (Task, Tech/Stack, Done criteria, Context) are fully specified in the user's opening message with no open scope questions. When in doubt, do not skip - grill.

| Signal | Route |
| --- | --- |
| Fully specified, zero ambiguity | **Skip** → Phase 1 |
| Large / multi-session / >~5 open scope questions / investigative unknowns | **`/wayfinder`** — chart the work as an investigation-ticket map, resolve, then resume Phase 1 with decisions folded in (Branch B) |
| Single-session scope, ambiguity is **chained** (each answer decides the next question) | **`/grilling`** — deep interactive depth, one question at a time (Branch A) |
| Single-session scope, ambiguity is **wide but independent** (many decisions, few dependencies) | **`batch-grill-me`** — multi-round frontier batches: ask every prerequisites-settled decision in one numbered round, recompute the frontier, repeat until empty (Branch A) |

Fold every answer (or the wayfinder map's decisions) into Phase 1 as if the user specified those fields upfront. See `references/clarity-gate.md` for the "which do I pick" test between the two grill paths and the full wayfinder routing test.

---

## Phase 1: Gather Inputs

| Field                 | What you need                                                                 | Required?                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task**              | What to build / fix / migrate — one sentence                                  | Yes                                                   |
| **Tech / Stack**      | Language, framework, runtime, key libraries                                   | Yes — pull from Context if given                      |
| **Key features**      | Explicit must-have list — what the agent must build, not infer                | Yes for build/create tasks                            |
| **Done criteria**     | Verifiable end state (test exits 0, file exists, queue empty)                 | Yes                                                   |
| **Quality bar**       | What "done well" looks like — polish level, production-readiness signal       | Yes — default: "production-grade, no rewrites needed" |
| **Context**           | Repo, docs, branch, access constraints                                        | Yes                                                   |
| **Stretch goals**     | Optional nice-to-haves — tackle only if ahead on turns                        | No — omit if none                                     |
| **Constraints**       | Cost ceilings, disruption risks, things that must NOT be touched unsupervised | No — but always ask for live/shared environments      |
| **Turn budget**       | Max turns before stopping                                                     | No — default 80                                       |
| **Compact threshold** | Context size triggering /compact                                              | No — default 170k                                     |
| **Blockers**          | What Claude should NOT do without a decision                                  | No                                                    |

**Intake rules:** Skip if all fields present. Ask Key features + Quality bar together if missing (one question). Extract Tech/Stack from Context if buried. Surface Constraints before emitting if task touches live env, shared DB, or per-call API.

**Ambiguous scope → `/to-prd` intake (optional):** If the task is underspecified and you're authoring interactively, run `/to-prd` first to turn the conversation into a `PRD.md` in the task working dir. The Planner then traces each phase slice's Parent to it (see `references/issue-tracker.md`). Skip for well-specified tasks — don't add ceremony a one-line goal doesn't need.

---

## Phase 1.5: Harness Discovery

**Execution: spawn 4 parallel Haiku/Explore agents — do not run inline.** Fan out after intake to map available skills, agents, CLI tools, and design the runtime harness.

**Agent 1 — Skill Scanner (Explore / Haiku)**

```
Read .claude/agent-context/snapshot.md for workspace context before starting.
Glob these skill locations: .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md, lg-*/skills/*/SKILL.md,
leadgrow-hq/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md, website/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md.
For each skill found, read its name and description fields from YAML frontmatter.
Return: array of {name, description, path} for skills relevant to this task: [TASK SUMMARY].
Relevant = skill description mentions any of: [key nouns from the task].
Max 8 results. If more match, prefer the most specific.
```

**Agent 2 — Agent Roster Scanner (Explore / Haiku)**

```
Read .claude/agent-context/snapshot.md for workspace context before starting.
Read .claude/rules/workflow.md (Agent Roster section) and
the available agent types listed in the session system reminder.
Return: array of {agentType, useFor} for agent types relevant to this task: [TASK SUMMARY].
Also note: is smart-searcher available? is task-orchestrator available?
```

**Agent 3 — CLI / Script Scanner (Explore / Haiku)**

```
Read .claude/agent-context/snapshot.md for workspace context before starting.
Check: (1) ~/.claude/reference/cli-map.md for CLI tools relevant to this task: [TASK SUMMARY].
(2) Glob leadgrow-hq/tools/**/*.py and leadgrow-hq/tools/**/*.ts — list scripts whose
filename suggests relevance to the task domain.
(3) Glob the skill's own scripts/ folder if a relevant skill was identified.
Return: array of {tool, purpose, invocation} for up to 5 relevant tools/scripts.
```

**Agent 4 — Harness Architect (Explore / Haiku)**

```
Read .claude/agent-context/snapshot.md for workspace context before starting.
Confirm harness agents exist in at least one of these locations (Glob both):
  - .claude/agents/harness-planner.md, harness-maker.md, harness-checker.md, harness-shipper.md
  - ~/.claude/agents/harness-planner.md, harness-maker.md, harness-checker.md, harness-shipper.md
Use the exact resolver output supplied by the parent; do not probe fallback paths yourself:
[SKILL_ROUTING_RESOLUTION]
[EXACT ROUTING_EVIDENCE JSON]
When selectedSource is project-local or canonical, read only normalizedPath. When selectedSource
is direct, do not read a routing file; use confirmed HARNESS routing or direct with a documented
direct quality bar. If status is not resolved or errors is non-empty, return BLOCKED instead of
designing routing.

Task being goal-prompted: [TASK SUMMARY]
Skills confirmed available (from Agent 1): [SKILL SCANNER RESULTS]

Write HARNESS.md content with SEVEN sections:

PLANNER_BRIEF:
What context files should Planner read first for this task?
What phases should PLAN.md have? What ordering/dependency constraints?
What turn budget split makes sense given task complexity?

MAKER_ROUTING:
Map each phase to a specific skill from the confirmed list, or "direct" if none match.
Format: "Phase N: <skill-name or direct> — <artifact it produces>"
Use selectedSource from [SKILL_ROUTING_RESOLUTION]:
- For project-local or canonical, follow only the routing heuristics in normalizedPath.
- For direct, do not read a routing file. Use confirmed skills where they match; otherwise use
  direct and state a task-specific direct implementation quality bar.

PROVER_BRIEF (include only if goal involves a running app — UI feature, API endpoint, or CLI behaviour; otherwise write "PROVER_BRIEF: N/A — static artifact goal"):
Feature intent: <one sentence — what the feature should do, from the goal>
How to exercise: <exact CLI command, curl call, or browser URL + steps>
Auth: <credentials or "no auth required">
Accept criteria: <observable output that means "works" — paste-able result>

REDTEAM_BRIEF (include only if the goal ships a running app, a user-facing flow, or security-sensitive code — otherwise write "REDTEAM_BRIEF: N/A"):
target: <one paragraph — what was built, written for attackers who owe it no charity>
paths: <files/dirs the red-team roles must read before attacking>
entryPoint: <how a user or caller reaches the feature>
outOfScope: <known-safe things not worth reporting>

CHECKER_BRIEF:
Which artifact paths should Checker evaluate?
What rubric dimensions (1-5) apply? What does a 5 look like vs a 1 for each?
What PASS threshold (default: mean ≥ 3.5/5.0)?
Note: checker agent file enforces fresh context — no extra isolation instructions needed.

SHIP_BRIEF:
Set `intent` to the user's original objective plus any decisions or constraints that a reviewer
cannot infer from the diff. State that Checker PASS is necessary but not sufficient: a separate
explicit shipping approval for the current invocation is also required. Do not spawn Shipper unless
both are present. Without shipping approval, terminate with `N/A - shipping not approved`. With
approval, spawn a fresh `harness-shipper` agent; that agent invokes `/no-mistakes` once and drives
it until `checks-passed`, `passed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`. Never infer approval from PASS, never
ship inline, and never invoke Shipper on ITERATE or PLATEAU. Treat `checks-passed` as "PR prepared
for human merge," not merged.

ORCHESTRATION NOTE (optional, for goals with concurrent phases):
If PLAN.md marks any phases as parallel-safe (e.g., red-team's four attack roles), reference the
provider-aware model resolver at `$PROJECT_ROOT/scripts/resolve-role-model.ts` and the concurrency
matrix in `docs/adr/0007-provider-aware-model-orchestration.md`. The resolver returns {model,
provider, tier} — a spawn descriptor consumable by parallel fan-outs without shared mutable state.
Each concurrent role resolves its model independently via `resolveRoleModel(role, detectedProvider)`.

LOOP_TRACKER:
A markdown checklist the running agent fills in as the loop progresses.
Emit exactly this template (fill in phase names from MAKER_ROUTING above;
omit Prover rows if PROVER_BRIEF is N/A; omit Red-team rows if REDTEAM_BRIEF is N/A):

```

Synthesize Agents 1-3 into `[TOOLS]` block. Agent 4 output becomes `HARNESS.md` (written in Phase 2.5 before length measurement). Omit `[TOOLS]` entirely if nothing relevant found — don't invent tools. Drop CLI tools first if tight on 4000-char limit. Phase 2.5 skills-exist check satisfied by discovery output — no re-glob needed.

---

## Phase 2: Format the Goal Condition

Standing protocol boilerplate does NOT go here. It lives in HARNESS.md (written in Phase 2.5) as standing sections the agent reads first, so it never competes for the 4000-char budget. The goal condition carries only task-specific content, a compact `[PARAMS]` block, and a lean `[HARNESS]` pointer. Keep total well under 4000 characters - aim for the brevity budget in Phase 2.5, not the ceiling.

```
[GOAL] <one-sentence verifiable end state — what the evaluator checks>

[DATE] <today's date in YYYY-MM-DD — deterministic, no Date.now()>

[TASK]
I'm handing you this task to run unsupervised overnight.

<full task description, precise scope>

Stack: <language / framework / runtime / key libraries>

Must include:
- <feature 1>
- <feature 2>
- <feature N — explicit, not inferred>

Quality bar: <what "done well" looks like>

Done means:
- <criterion 1 — existence: file X exists>
- <criterion 2 — quality: file X cites ≥N sources / has ≥N lines / passes grep for Y>
- <criterion 3 — no silent downgrades: HANDOFF.md lists any phase marked DRAFT>

Stretch goals (tackle only if ahead on turns — do NOT delay required work):
- <optional nice-to-have 1>
[Omit this block entirely if no stretch goals were specified]

Use this context:
<repo path / branch / docs / access / constraints>

[TOOLS]
<populated from Phase 1.5 discovery — omit entirely if nothing relevant found>

[PARAMS]
Reward signal: <single programmatic metric — the qualitative gate produces it>
Done: <exact threshold — e.g. mechanical gate passes AND mean rubric ≥ 4.0/5.0>
Max cycles: <N — default 3>
Turn limit: <max_turns — default 80>
[Constraints — include the two lines below ONLY if the task touches live data, shared infra, or a per-call cost API; omit entirely otherwise]
Cost ceiling: <e.g. stay under $5 in API calls total>
Do NOT touch: <live table / running job / shared sheet>

[HARNESS]
Read <absolute-path>/HARNESS.md before starting and follow it end to end. Its standing sections
carry the protocol: EXECUTION_PROTOCOL (the 5-stage Planner→Maker→Prover→Checker→Ship flow),
EVAL_LOOP, BLOCKERS, PROOF_PROTOCOL, MORNING_REPORT, CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT, TURN_LIMIT. Use the
task-specific values in [PARAMS] above wherever a section references them. The per-task briefs
(PLANNER_BRIEF, MAKER_ROUTING, PROVER_BRIEF, REDTEAM_BRIEF, CHECKER_BRIEF, SHIP_BRIEF) and
LOOP_TRACKER live there too.
Before stage 1, the goal parent runs the exact safe snippet generated in Execution Router Step 0.1:
[ROUTING_GUARD]
<exact stdout from resolver --emit-shell-guard mode>
A nonzero result stops before Planner.
```

---

## Phase 2.5: QA Validation

**Execution: spawn 1-3 parallel Haiku/Explore agents — do not run inline.**

### Step 0 — Write HARNESS.md (before measuring)

Write `HARNESS.md` to the task working directory using Agent 4 output from Phase 1.5. It holds
two kinds of content:

**A. Task-customized briefs** (from Agent 4): `PLANNER_BRIEF`, `MAKER_ROUTING`, `PROVER_BRIEF`,
`REDTEAM_BRIEF`, `CHECKER_BRIEF`, `SHIP_BRIEF`, followed by `LOOP_TRACKER`.

**B. Standing protocol sections** - the boilerplate moved OUT of the goal condition so it stops
eating the 4000-char budget. These are GENERIC: write them verbatim into every HARNESS.md exactly
as printed below. Do NOT bake task-specific values into them - max cycles, done threshold, turn
count, cost ceiling, and do-not-touch all come from the goal's `[PARAMS]` block, which each section
references. The seven standing sections are `EXECUTION_PROTOCOL`, `EVAL_LOOP`, `CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT`,
`BLOCKERS`, `PROOF_PROTOCOL`, `MORNING_REPORT`, `TURN_LIMIT`.

Write these seven sections verbatim:

```text
EXECUTION_PROTOCOL
Five-stage execution. Before stage 1, the goal parent runs the [ROUTING_GUARD] snippet from the
goal condition; a nonzero result stops before Planner. On success, pass exact `ROUTING_EVIDENCE`
stdout to Planner under `[SKILL_ROUTING_RESOLUTION]`; do not parse or reformat it in the parent.
1. Planner (turns 1-5): consume the routing resolution, decompose task → write PLAN.md (phases,
   exact routing evidence, selected source/fallback, checker rubric), then mirror each phase to a
   durable slice in `issues/NN-<slug>.md` (survives /compact, tracks per-phase Status). PLAN.md
   `## Phases` stays canonical; slices are the durable drive-list. Do not produce task artifacts
   until PLAN.md is written.
2. Maker (turns 6-<N>): execute per PLAN.md, invoke skills per phase, commit at each phase boundary.
3. Prover (running-app goals only): spawn harness-prover with PROVER_BRIEF. Pass feature intent +
   exercise instructions. Get PROOF VERDICT before Checker. Skip entirely for static artifact goals
   (PROVER_BRIEF: N/A).
3b. Red-team (adversarial-verify goals — running app, user-facing flow, or security-sensitive
   code): run the red-team Workflow (`.claude/workflows/red-team.js`) with REDTEAM_BRIEF (target,
   paths, entryPoint). Feed its worst-first holes back to the Maker as fix input BEFORE Checker
   scores. Skip for static/internal artifacts (REDTEAM_BRIEF: N/A).
4. Checker: spawn fresh harness-checker subagent with CHECKER_BRIEF. Pass artifact paths + PROOF
   VERDICT (if running-app goal). Checker opens "I did not write this." Writes scores to CYCLE_LOG.md.
5. Ship (only after Checker PASS plus separate explicit shipping approval for this invocation):
   if approval is absent, do not spawn the Shipper and record `N/A - shipping not approved` as the
   terminal shipping outcome. If approval is present, spawn a fresh `harness-shipper` agent with
   SHIP_BRIEF.intent, project root, branch, and both approval signals. The shipper invokes
   `/no-mistakes`; the goal agent must never drive it inline. `checks-passed` means the PR is ready
   for human review/merge; do not wait for merge. Do not run this stage for ITERATE or PLATEAU.

Work through the task to completion. If you hit a blocker, do not stop. Use mocks, stubs, or
documented assumptions. Record each workaround and continue with everything that does not require
my decision.

EVAL_LOOP
At turn 1, before any other work, write your eval plan in HANDOFF.md under "Eval Loop Design". Do
not start the task until this is written. Pull the reward signal, done condition, and max cycles
from the goal's [PARAMS] block. Include:
  - Reward signal: <from [PARAMS]>
  - Mechanical gate: <fast binary check — runs in seconds, no LLM judgment>
  - Qualitative gate: <scored check — produces the reward signal>
  - Max cycles: <from [PARAMS] — default 3>
  - Done condition: <from [PARAMS]>

Then execute the task using this loop — repeat up to max_cycles times:
  1. Generate output (inputs are fixed — do not change the spec, only the output)
  2. Run mechanical gate — if it fails, fix and re-run before proceeding to step 3
  2b. Adversarial-verify goals only: run the red-team Workflow (REDTEAM_BRIEF). Fix every
     critical/high hole it returns before step 3. Skip if REDTEAM_BRIEF: N/A.
  3. Spawn checker subagent (CHECKER_BRIEF) — pass artifact paths only, not your context. Checker
     opens "I did not write this." Writes dimension scores + reward signal to CYCLE_LOG.md.
  4. If done condition met → commit, proceed to next phase
  5. If not → read CYCLE_LOG.md, fix only the lowest-scoring dimension, return to step 1
  6. If 3 consecutive cycles produce the same reward signal → exit loop (plateau), commit current
     best, note "plateau after N cycles" in HANDOFF.md

Log each cycle to HANDOFF.md: cycle number, mechanical gate result, reward signal score, what
changed. After each cycle, update the LOOP_TRACKER section — check off completed steps, fill in
paths, SHAs, and reward signals. After the first PASS, exit the eval loop. Run the Ship stage
exactly once only when the current invocation also contains separate explicit shipping approval.
Otherwise do not spawn Shipper, record `N/A - shipping not approved` in HANDOFF.md and LOOP_TRACKER,
and terminate successfully. If an approved Ship stage returns `failed` or `cancelled`, report that
terminal outcome; do not describe the change as merge-ready.

CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT
Run /compact when context approaches the compact threshold (default 170k tokens). After compacting,
state your current checkpoint before continuing. Do NOT compact on turn 1.

BLOCKERS
If you hit a hard blocker: mock/stub it, document in HANDOFF.md under "Needs My Decision", and
continue all work that does not depend on the blocked piece. Skill/process failures use tiered
fallbacks — never silently downgrade substance:
- Tier 1: Run the same process manually (same depth, same searches)
- Tier 2: Reduced scope — mark artifact quality: draft in frontmatter
- Tier 3: Skeleton from trained knowledge — mark quality: placeholder, flag in HANDOFF
If a constraint from [PARAMS] would be violated: stop that task, document in HANDOFF.md under
"Constraint Block", and continue with everything that doesn't violate.

PROOF_PROTOCOL
Every completed phase needs proof, not assertion. After each phase append to PROGRESS.md:
  Phase N: <name> — COMPLETE
  Artifact: <absolute-path>
  Proof: <actual command output — paste it, don't describe it>
  e.g. "npm test: 47 passed, 0 failed" not "tests pass"
  e.g. "wc -l output.md: 312 lines" not "file written"
  e.g. "grep -c 'https://' research.md: 34 sources" not "well-sourced"
  Commit: <SHA>
Never write "Phase N complete" without proof on the line below it.

MORNING_REPORT
By morning, leave me the morning report in the task's working directory:
1. HANDOFF.md — what completed, workarounds, needs my decision, evidence
2. HANDOFF.html — single-page visual summary (see references/morning-report-specs.md)
3. HANDOFF.excalidraw — architecture/flow diagram (see references/morning-report-specs.md)
Then PUBLISH the report so I wake up to a link, not a file on disk:
4. Run `lavish-axi share HANDOFF.html` — publishes to a hosted URL (headless-safe HTTPS POST, no
   browser needed). Publish PUBLIC: do NOT pass --password. The link must open in one click from
   anywhere, including a comment on the no-mistakes PR — a password gate makes the report
   single-player. The trade: anyone with the URL can read it, so keep credentials, tokens, and
   client PII OUT of the report body — gate the value, not the page. Record the hosted URL in a
   "## 📋 Published Report" block at the TOP of HANDOFF.md. The update_key is still a secret: write
   it to HANDOFF.secret.local, add that filename to .gitignore immediately — it is
   update/delete-capable and MUST NEVER be committed. If ht-ml.app is unreachable, fall back to
   `lavish-axi export HANDOFF.html --out HANDOFF.export.html` and note why in HANDOFF.md.
   See references/morning-report-specs.md.

TURN_LIMIT
Stop after the turn limit in [PARAMS] (default 80). If not done, write all three morning-report
files anyway, then publish per MORNING_REPORT step 4.
```

Then update the `[HARNESS]` block in the goal candidate so the first line names the real path:
`Read <absolute-path>/HARNESS.md before starting and follow it end to end.` Replace the
`[ROUTING_GUARD]` placeholder with exact stdout from resolver `--emit-shell-guard` mode. Never
interpolate or re-quote its paths. Any unresolved placeholder blocks emission.

The task working directory is `$PROJECT_ROOT/.harness/goals/<task-slug>/` (resolved in
Execution Router Step 0). Write HARNESS.md there and use that absolute path.

This step happens before length measurement — the HARNESS.md content (both the task briefs and the
standing protocol sections) is NOT inlined into the goal prompt. The goal only carries the path
reference plus the `[PARAMS]` values the standing sections consume.

### LENGTH GATE — TWO-SIDED, MEASURED, NO EXCEPTIONS

**4000 is the rejection line, NOT a budget to fill.** `/goal` rejects any condition ≥4000 characters ("Goal condition is limited to 4000 characters") — a rejected goal is a failed deliverable. But a prompt that merely *clears* 4000 can still be bloated. The default equilibrium of this skill is drift toward the ceiling: the QA checklist only ever tells you to ADD blocks, so an unchecked prompt fills to ~3990. That is the failure the last few long prompts came from.

So the gate is two-sided:
- **Hard cap 4000 / safe target 3990** — over this is BLOCKED, non-negotiable (mechanical, DO NOT eyeball).
- **Brevity budget ~1500** (single-phase) / **~2500** (multi-phase) — over this is a WARN, not a block. It means: compress unless every block earns its place. These budgets dropped once the ~6000 chars of standing protocol moved to HARNESS.md; a normal lean goal now lands around 1200-2500 chars. Aim for the *shortest* prompt that still passes the dry-run self-check, not the longest that fits.

Before emitting, you MUST run this sequence as actual shell commands (not mentally):

**Step 1 — write candidate to file:**

```
Write (tool) → temp/_goal-candidate.txt
```

**Step 2 — measure and gate in one command (Bun, cross-platform — run via Bash tool):**

```bash
bun skills/write-goal-prompt/scripts/check-goal-length.ts temp/_goal-candidate.txt
```

This counts exactly what `/goal` counts (UTF-16 `String.length` after stripping one trailing newline), prints `[Measured: XXXX chars]`, and **exits non-zero if the candidate is ≥3990** — so a failed gate is a failed command, not a judgment call. Adjust the ceiling with `--target N` / `--cap N` if needed.

Fallback if Bun is unavailable (note the `encoding="utf-8"` — WITHOUT it, Python opens in the Windows codepage and over-counts every non-ASCII char, falsely blocking valid prompts):

```bash
python -c "txt=open('temp/_goal-candidate.txt', encoding='utf-8').read().rstrip('\n'); print(len(txt))"
```

The script prints `WARN` when the candidate is over the brevity budget but under the cap. Pass `--brevity 2500` for a genuinely multi-phase task; do not raise it just to silence the warning.

**Step 3 — gate:**

- Command **exits non-zero** (≥3990) → BLOCKED. Compress (see `references/qa-checklist.md` Length Gate steps). Re-write file. Re-run Step 2. Repeat until it exits 0.
- Command prints **WARN** (≥ brevity budget, < 3990) → not blocked, but run the necessity pass in `references/qa-checklist.md` (Brevity Pass) before emitting: cut filler, move inlined detail to a reference file. Emit only what survives.
- Command **exits 0 with OK** (< brevity budget) → pass. Proceed.

**Step 4 — emit with proof:**
Copy the `[Measured: XXXX chars]` line the script prints, immediately before the code fence. No measured count = gate not run = failure.

Never emit an unmeasured or ≥4000 goal. "Looks about right" is a failure. `wc -m` does NOT work on Windows — use the command above always.

### Remaining QA

Fix any failure before emitting: (1) context verification — subagents confirm paths/skills exist (2) dry-run self-check — 12 checks (3) eval loop check — signal programmatic, gate fast, max_cycles set, done condition a threshold. Full checklists in `references/qa-checklist.md`.

## Phase 3: Output

**In-session harness mode:** Emit as a code fence. Add: **"Paste this into a Sonnet session. `/goal clear` to abort early."** See `EXAMPLES.md` for a complete worked example.

All goal execution remains attached to the current Claude Code session. Do not emit or start a detached runner.

## Readiness and Worktree Path

Run the supported preflight before task execution. It reports repository, branch, dirty-tree, pipeline-layout, and isolation state as one JSON object.

**Check only - no mutation:**

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File C:\Users\mitch\Everything_CC\tools\agent\agent-harness\scripts\prepare-harness-run.ps1 `
  -RepoPath "$PROJECT_ROOT" -WorkspaceRoot "$WORKSPACE_ROOT" -CheckOnly
```

Isolation is required by default, so a plain `-CheckOnly` reports `isolationRequired: true` and `status: "NOT_READY"` until isolation is prepared (or the run opts out — see below). A nonzero result includes exact errors and dirty paths. Resolve those errors manually; the preflight never commits, stashes, resets, switches branches, or starts task execution.

**Prepare the default isolation:**

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File C:\Users\mitch\Everything_CC\tools\agent\agent-harness\scripts\prepare-harness-run.ps1 `
  -RepoPath "$PROJECT_ROOT" -WorkspaceRoot "$WORKSPACE_ROOT" -PrepareIsolation -Parallel `
  -LeaseHolder harness-<slug>
```

Use returned `runPath` for isolated work. Return the lease deliberately after review. For trivial, read-only, or throwaway work, pass `-NoIsolation` instead to run on the current feature branch with no worktree — canonical monorepo-tracked pipelines always require the isolated path and reject `-NoIsolation`. Full lifecycle and remediation: `references/parallel-execution.md`.

Rules:

- Isolation is the default: prepare a treehouse worktree for real runs; reserve `-NoIsolation` for trivial/read-only checks.
- Run readiness for `$PROJECT_ROOT` with `$WORKSPACE_ROOT` passed separately; never target the workspace root or `pipelines/` parent.
- Work only on a non-default feature branch.
- Stop on any dirty path; never mutate work to make preflight pass.
- Keep `scripts/validate-pipeline-layout.ps1` enforcement active.
- No command in this skill starts detached work.

## Execution Mode Routing

Before writing a goal prompt, route the task to the right execution shape using `references/execution-mode-routing.md`. This is about _task shape_ (single-run vs goal-loop vs time-loop vs dynamic-workflow), not about harness infrastructure (attached session vs explicit treehouse isolation - see the "Execution Router" section above).

**Benchmark detection runs first (ADR-0004).** Before task shape, apply the benchmark-detection key from `references/execution-mode-routing.md` ("Prior axis"): does the goal name a measurable benchmark — a metric plus a direction? If yes, this is a benchmarking goal, not a build goal — **offer to switch** to `/benchmarking-loop` and load `references/benchmark-intake.md` (the lazy branch; a plain build goal never loads it, so this stays lean). `/write-goal-prompt` and `/benchmarking-loop` are two front doors over one shared grill, so detection catches a mis-invoked door from either side. Only if the goal is a plain build goal (artifact + quality bar, no exogenous metric+direction) do you continue with the phases below.

The router decision tree is first-match-wins: walk the four questions top-down and stop at the first yes. Dynamic-workflow shape (for parallel verification, adversarial red-team, or 50+ item processing) is exemplified by `.claude/workflows/red-team.js`, which runs four attack roles in parallel, deduplicates findings by severity, and validates both per-role and merged output.

**Embedding a workflow inside a goal loop.** A dynamic workflow does not always mean _leaving_ the goal loop — it can nest in one phase. When the goal ships a running app, a user-facing flow, or security-sensitive code, the red-team Workflow nests in the **verify phase**: Agent 4 emits a `REDTEAM_BRIEF`, the `[HARNESS]` block runs `.claude/workflows/red-team.js` (step 3b) before Checker, and the Maker fixes every critical/high hole first. This is complementary to the Prover — Prover proves the feature _works_, red-team proves it _doesn't break_. Static or internal-artifact goals omit it (`REDTEAM_BRIEF: N/A`), exactly as they skip the Prover. Reach for a _standalone_ Workflow (route away from `/goal`) only when the whole task is dynamic-workflow shape (50+ items, many independent hypotheses), not just its verify step.

Planner reads `references/execution-mode-routing.md` as the first step after intake, and emits the chosen shape in PLAN.md's "Execution shape" section.

**Note:** This section (task shape) is orthogonal to the "Execution Router" section near the top of this file (infrastructure choice: attached session or explicit treehouse isolation). Both axes inform a full execution plan, but they answer different questions - mode routing is shape, while the Router is infrastructure.
