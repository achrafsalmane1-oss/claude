// Goal-prompt length gate — the enforced version of SKILL.md's HARD LENGTH GATE.
// Replicates /goal's own counting exactly: strips ONE trailing newline, then counts
// UTF-16 code units — i.e. JS String.length, which is what /goal (a JS/Electron app)
// checks against 4000. Exits non-zero if the candidate would be rejected or is over the
// safe target, so it can gate a commit/emit step instead of relying on the agent to eyeball.
//
// Why not the documented `python -c "len(open(f).read()...)"`? On Windows that opens in the
// locale codepage (cp1252), not UTF-8, so every non-ASCII char (e.g. an em-dash, 3 UTF-8
// bytes) is mis-decoded into ~3 chars and the count is inflated — it can falsely BLOCK a
// prompt that /goal would accept. This script decodes UTF-8 and counts UTF-16 units, so it
// matches the real limit. (If you must use the python one-liner, add encoding="utf-8".)
//
// Usage:
//   bun check-goal-length.ts [path] [--cap N] [--target N] [--brevity N]
//   path      defaults to temp/_goal-candidate.txt (relative to cwd)
//   --cap     hard limit /goal rejects at (default 4000)
//   --target  safe ceiling with margin (default 3990)
//   --brevity soft budget: over this warns but does NOT block (default 1500)
//
// The gate is TWO-SIDED. 4000 is /goal's rejection line, not a budget to fill. A prompt
// that clears the hard cap can still be needlessly long. The brevity tier surfaces that:
// over --brevity prints WARN (compress unless every char earns its place) but exits 0, so
// it never blocks a genuinely complex multi-phase prompt — it just kills the silent drift
// to the ceiling. Raise --brevity for known-large multi-phase tasks (e.g. --brevity 2500).
// Budgets dropped from 2200/2800 once the standing protocol boilerplate moved from the goal
// condition into HARNESS.md — a normal lean goal now lands around 1200-2500 chars.
//
// Exit codes: 0 = pass (< target; may WARN if >= brevity) · 1 = blocked (>= target or >= cap) · 2 = file unreadable.
