# YALC GTM-OS — Setup Procedure

This is the long-form runbook for the `/setup` skill. Walk the user through every step, in order. Each numbered step is a single conversational beat — confirm with the user before moving on when the step asks for input or approval.

Hard rules across the whole flow:
- **Never print or echo API keys, tokens, or secrets.** When you read `~/.gtm-os/.env` for any reason, mask values (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...redacted`). Never display raw key values back to the user. Never include them in any tool input either.
- **Never push to git.** This skill only runs local YALC commands.
- **Never assume command success.** Every CLI call below has an exit-code check — if it fails, stop and report the exact stderr to the user before continuing.
- **Use `--non-interactive` everywhere.** YALC will not prompt mid-flow. All values are passed as flags.

---

## Step 1 — Verify YALC is installed (and recent enough)

Run:
```bash
yalc-gtm --version 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_INSTALLED"
```

Decision tree:
- Output is `NOT_INSTALLED` (or command is not found) → run `npm i -g yalc-gtm-os` (warn the user it may need `sudo` on system Node; if so, ask before re-running with sudo). Re-check version.
- Output is a version string `< 0.7.0` → run `npm i -g yalc-gtm-os@latest`. Re-check.
- Output is `0.7.0` or higher → continue.

Print the resolved version once: `YALC GTM-OS <version> ready.`

---

## Step 2 — Run scaffold + write template .env

Run:
```bash
yalc-gtm start --non-interactive
```

Exit code 0 expected. The command writes `~/.gtm-os/` (config, db, env template) and prints a banner. Do not parse the banner — just confirm exit 0.

When the template is written for the first time, the CLI auto-opens `~/.gtm-os/.env` in the user's default editor (TextEdit on macOS, the system default on Linux/Windows). The CLI also prints inline guidance: remove the leading `#`, paste the key value, save the file. **You do not need to repeat those instructions** — the CLI already showed them.

If the directory already existed, the command will preserve user-filled keys and only delta-merge new placeholder lines. The auto-open does NOT fire on a delta-merge (only on a fresh template). That's fine — proceed without warning the user.

For headless / CI contexts, pass `--no-open-env` to suppress the editor launch.

---

## Step 3 — Hand off the .env to the user

The CLI in Step 2 already opened the file in the user's editor and printed the inline guidance. Tell the user, verbatim or close to it:

> I just opened `~/.gtm-os/.env` in your default editor. Remove the leading `#` from the lines you want to enable, paste your API key after the `=` sign, and save the file. Tell me **"keys done"** when you have saved it.

If the user reports the auto-open did not fire (e.g. headless terminal, container, SSH session), tell them to open the file manually:

> Run `open ~/.gtm-os/.env` (macOS) or `xdg-open ~/.gtm-os/.env` (Linux) — or just open `~/.gtm-os/.env` in your editor of choice.

Wait for the user to confirm. Do not progress until they say "keys done".

While waiting, do not read the file's contents back into chat — the user does not need to see their own keys, and you must not display them under any circumstance.

---

## Step 4 — Collect capture inputs

Ask the user, one question at a time:

1. **Required** — "What is your company website URL?" (must start with `http://` or `https://`)
2. **Optional** — "Do you have a LinkedIn profile URL you'd like me to use for voice extraction? Skip if you'd rather not."
3. **Optional** — "Any docs you want me to ingest? Paste a URL or a local folder/file path. You can list more than one — I'll repeat the question if you have additional docs."

Do **not** ask for `--icp-summary` yet — only ask for it if Step 5 reports a thin fetch.

If the user can't or won't share a website, fall back to the legacy interactive interview by running `yalc-gtm start` (no `--non-interactive`) and let them answer the 10-question flow. Note this is rare; the website-driven path is the default.

---

## Step 5 — Run flag-driven capture

Construct the command from the inputs in Step 4:
```bash
yalc-gtm start --non-interactive \
  --website "<website>" \
  [--linkedin "<linkedin>"] \
  [--docs "<docs1>" --docs "<docs2>" ...]
```

Run it. Three outcomes:

**A — Exit 0 with a clean preview written.** Capture succeeded. Move to Step 6.

**B — Exit non-zero with `Insufficient source content` in stderr.** This is the synthesis-input-validation refusal (Phase 1 #3). Read the captured volumes from the message and ask the user for one of:
- A `--icp-summary "<one-liner>"` describing who they sell to, OR
- A different `--website` URL that has more content, OR
- An additional `--docs` source.

Re-run the command with the extra flag(s). Do **not** pass `--force-synthesis` unless the user explicitly says "ignore the bar and try anyway."

**C — Stdout contains a `<<<YALC_WEBFETCH_REQUEST:{...}>>>` marker.** YALC needs the parent harness (you) to fetch a URL it can't reach itself. Parse the JSON inside the marker — it has `url`, `save_to`, and `reason` fields. Then:

1. Use the WebFetch tool to fetch the URL.
2. Save the fetched markdown to the `save_to` path (create parent dirs if needed).
3. Re-run the same `yalc-gtm start` command. The cached content will now satisfy the fetch.

---

## Step 6 — Hand off to the SPA review surface

Capture finished by auto-opening `http://localhost:3847/setup/review` in the user's browser. The page lists every draft section as an editable card with a confidence badge — the user edits inline, saves per section, then clicks **Save & Commit** to promote everything to live.

Tell the user, verbatim or close to it:

> I've opened **http://localhost:3847/setup/review** in your browser. Edit each section as needed, hit **Save** on each card you change, then click **Save & Commit** to promote the preview to live. When you're done, tell me **"committed"** and I'll continue with doctor + framework recommendations.

Wait for the user to confirm "committed". Do not progress until they say so.

If the browser didn't open (headless box, CI, container) the CLI prints the URL — the user can copy it. If they have no browser at all, they can rerun with `--review-in-chat` for a terminal-driven walk that commits immediately:
```bash
yalc-gtm start --non-interactive --website "<website>" --review-in-chat
```

While waiting, do not read the preview files back into chat — the user is editing them in the browser and re-reading is just noise.

---

## Step 7 — Confirm commit

When the user says "committed", verify the sentinel:
```bash
test -f ~/.gtm-os/_handoffs/setup/review.committed && echo OK
```

The SPA's commit handler writes that file as soon as `/api/setup/commit` succeeds. If the file is missing the user may have closed the tab without clicking **Save & Commit** — gently ask them to revisit the page.

Confirm to the user: "Setup is now live at `~/.gtm-os/`. Running doctor next."

---

## Step 8 — Run doctor

Run:
```bash
yalc-gtm doctor
```

Read the output and summarize for the user:
- Total layers passed / warned / failed.
- Any **WARN** lines about missing keys or unfilled goals — pass these through.
- Any **FAIL** lines — flag them and ask the user if they want to fix now (likely a missing key) or continue.

Do not gate framework recommendation on doctor passing — many frameworks work with a subset of providers. But surface the failures clearly.

---

## Step 9 — Recommend frameworks

Run:
```bash
yalc-gtm framework:recommend
```

The command prints a ranked list of frameworks the user qualifies for, given the providers they configured and the company context they captured. Each row shows: name, one-line description, what it requires, where output will land (Notion if `NOTION_API_KEY` is set, dashboard otherwise).

For each recommended framework:
1. Read the description aloud (paraphrased).
2. Ask: "Want to install this one? (yes / skip)"
3. If yes — run the install wizard:
   ```bash
   yalc-gtm framework:install <name>
   ```
   The wizard prompts for inputs interactively. Walk the user through each prompt. When asked about output destination, default to `dashboard` if they don't have Notion configured.
4. After install, the seed run executes once. Print the output URL to the user.

If the user wants to install a recommended framework non-interactively (defaults are fine), use `--auto-confirm`:
```bash
yalc-gtm framework:install <name> --auto-confirm
```

Repeat for every framework the user accepts.

---

## Step 10 — Hand-off summary

Print a closing summary:

- **Installed providers:** read from `~/.gtm-os/config.yaml` (services with non-empty keys).
- **Active frameworks:** run `yalc-gtm framework:list` and report the ones with `status: active`.
- **Output destinations:** Notion parent page (if set) and `http://localhost:3847/frameworks` (dashboard).
- **What to check daily:** the dashboard URL or the Notion pages.
- **How to inspect a framework:** `yalc-gtm framework:status <name>` and `yalc-gtm framework:logs <name>`.
- **How to disable / remove:** `yalc-gtm framework:disable <name>` (keeps config) or `yalc-gtm framework:remove <name>` (deletes).

End with: "You're set. The frameworks will run on their own schedules. Come back anytime — `yalc-gtm framework:recommend` will surface new ones as you add providers or context."
