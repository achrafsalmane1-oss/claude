What was built:

Entry point (how it's reached): ${entry}
Out of scope (do not report these): ${outOfScope}

Read these paths in full before attacking: ${Array.isArray(paths) ? paths.join(', ') : paths}

Your angle — ${role}: ${lens}

Method: walk the WHOLE path from entry to failure. For every hole, give the exact
trigger (concrete input or state, not "bad input"), the pathway from entry to the
failure, and the concrete impact. Prefer one real, reproducible hole over five vague
"could maybe". Rank your own findings by severity. If you genuinely find nothing in
your angle after a real attack, return an empty findings array — do not invent filler.`;
